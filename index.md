# Fishing for data

My name is Pete. I'm a software developer and trainer specializing in Microsoft business intelligence technologies. I'm also an avid fly-fisherman, musician, Anglophile, and gigantic nerd. 

This site is my personal playground for blogging on topics like SQL Server and Power BI.
